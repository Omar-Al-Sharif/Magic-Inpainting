# Magic-Inpainting - Image Inpainting and Texture Synthesis

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an advanced Image Inpainting and Texture Synthesis algorithm. The primary goal of this project is to intelligently remove unwanted objects from images and seamlessly fill the void with a similar background texture, creating visually appealing and natural results.

## Features

- **Object Removal:** Efficiently detects and removes unwanted objects from images.
- **Texture Synthesis:** Generates background textures that seamlessly blend with the surroundings.
- **Seamless Blending:** Ensures a smooth integration of the synthesized texture with the inpainted region.
- **Interactive Selection:** Allows users to interactively select objects for removal using masks.
- **Real-Time Inpainting:** Supports real-time inpainting for video content.
